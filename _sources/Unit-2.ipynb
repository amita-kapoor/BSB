    "## Introduction\n",
    "Have you ever watched a detective in a story?\n",
    "They don’t guess.\n",
    "They observe, compare, collect clues, and finally discover the hidden pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Data Detective does exactly the same thing, but instead of fingerprints and footprints, we look at numbers inside a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A  story from the past\n",
    "Long before computers existed, Indian scholars were already practicing the skills of a Data Detective - observing nature carefully, noting patterns, and drawing reasoned conclusions. Their tools were simple: the sky, the seasons, and years of patient observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ancient India, astronomers and scholars followed the principle of *Parīkṣā* - systematic observation.\n",
    "Texts such as the Br̥hat Saṁhitā (6th century CE) describe how scholars watched cloud formations, winds, rainfall patterns, and the movement of the sun and stars. Their goal was not guesswork, but careful measurement and logical inference, known as *Anumāna*.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations were recorded over long periods, sometimes in palm-leaf manuscripts, and later used to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the monsoon might arrive\n",
    "* How seasonal temperature varied\n",
    "* Which months were favourable for farming\n",
    "* How celestial patterns relate to timekeeping\n",
    "\n",
    "While they did not have digital datasets, they did something very similar: They collected data, looked for patterns, and made predictions based on evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, when you analyze weather data today, you are continuing a tradition that goes back more than a thousand years — only with tools that scholars of the past would have considered magical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity 2.1: Creating and Loading Your First Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a small weather dataset.\n",
    "This dataset has three columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature (°C)\n",
    "* Humidity (%)\n",
    "* Air Pressure (hPa)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with just 10 entries, similar to 10 days of simple observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the dataset for you to read it:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day | Temperature (°C) | Humidity (%) | Air Pressure (hPa) |\n",
    "| --- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n",
    "| 1   | 22               | 60           | 1012               |\n",
    "| 2   | 24               | 62           | 1010               |\n",
    "| 3   | 25               | 58           | 1011               |\n",
    "| 4   | 23               | 65           | 1013               |\n",
    "| 5   | 26               | 70           | 1014               |\n",
    "| 6   | 27               | 72           | 1012               |\n",
    "| 7   | 28               | 68           | 1011               |\n",
    "| 8   | 24               | 64           | 1013               |\n",
    "| 9   | 22               | 59           | 1010               |\n",
    "| 10  | 23               | 61           | 1012               |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will put this same information into Python so the computer can work with it. We will use the pandas library, which helps Python handle tables of data. Pandas stores a table in a structure called a DataFrame, which is simply a digital version of the table you saw above.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📘 **Learning Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In Python, a dictionary is a way of storing information in pairs. Each pair has a name and a list of values. You can think of it like a labelled box, where each label has its own list. \n",
    "> For example, in our weather data:\n",
    "> * \"Temperature\" is a label, and it has a list of temperature values\n",
    "> * \"Humidity\" is another label, with its own list\n",
    "> * \"AirPressure\" is another label, with its own list\n",
    ">All these lists have the same length, so each position together forms one row of data.\n",
    "> When we give this dictionary to pandas, it converts it into a DataFrame.\n",
    "A DataFrame is simply a digital table, like a table you draw in your notebook, with:\n",
    "> * column names at the top\n",
    "> * rows of values below\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So in simple terms:\n",
    "> * Dictionary helps us organise data by column\n",
    "> * DataFrame helps us see and work with the data as a table\n",
    "> This is why we first write the data as a dictionary and then convert it into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create this DataFrame directly inside Python."

    "The goal of this activity is not to get a single correct answer but to practice the habit of observing, comparing, and drawing simple conclusions. This is the same habit ancient scholars used when they studied patterns in the sky and weather. By combining numbers with visual patterns, you get a clearer picture of what the dataset is telling you.\n",

    "## Activity 2.5: Your Data Detective Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You have now explored the dataset in three different ways: by reading the numbers, by calculating the mean–median–mode, and by looking at a histogram. Each method gives you a different kind of clue. The final step is to put these clues together and write a short summary of what you discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at your DataFrame again, your statistical measures, and your histogram, and try to describe what the data is showing. A summary does not need to be long. It just needs to explain what patterns you noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some guiding questions you can think about while writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What can you say about the temperature values over these ten days?\n",
    "  *Hint: Look at how the temperatures move from day to day. Are they jumping a lot or slowly increasing? Do they stay in a narrow range or a wide range?*\n",
    "* Does the humidity seem mostly high, mostly low, or somewhere in the middle?\n",
    "  *Hint: Think about the numbers in the Humidity column and the bars in your histogram. Which humidity range had the tallest bar? That tells you where most of the days are.*\n",
    "* Did the histogram show a clear cluster or spread-out values?\n",
    "  *Hint: Look at whether many bars are tall in one area, or if the bars are more evenly spread out across the whole x-axis. A cluster means many values gathered close together.*\n",
    "* Which measure (mean, median, or mode) helped you the most in understanding the data?\n",
    "  *Hint: Think about which value felt closest to what you saw in the table and the histogram. Did the mean seem typical? Did the median match the middle? Did the mode appear often in the list?*"

    "## Practice Exercises\n",

    "\n",
    "1. What is the highest humidity value in the dataset?\n",
    "What is the lowest?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can use `df[\"Humidity\"].max()` and `df[\"Humidity\"].min()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How many days had a temperature greater than 24°C?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use a condition:\n",
    "`df[df[\"Temperature\"] > 24]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a histogram for the Temperature column.\n",
    "Does it look similar to the humidity histogram or different? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `plt.hist(df[\"Temperature\"], bins=5)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the range of Air Pressure (maximum minus minimum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Subtract `min()` from `max()`.\n",
