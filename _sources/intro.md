# Welcome to the Interactive Data Science Lab

**Class IX & X | Bhartiya Shiksha Board (BSB)**

Welcome to your new **Live Lab Manual** for Data Analysis and Visualization!

This book is designed to accompany your **Mathematics and Computer Science** curriculum, following the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) of the Bhartiya Shiksha Board.

Unlike a traditional textbook, this book is **alive**. You don't just read the code here—you can run it, change it, and see the results instantly.

## 🚀 How to Launch the Lab

To start the interactive features, follow these simple steps:

1.  Look for the **Rocket Icon** 🚀 at the top of the page.
2.  Click it and select **"Live Code"**.

### ⏳ Please Be Patient!
When you click "Live Code," a remote computer is being built in the cloud *specifically for you*.
* **It may take 1 or 2 minutes to start.**
* You will see a status bar saying "Waiting for kernel..." or "Building...".
* Once it says **"Ready"**, you can start coding!

## 🎮 How to Use the Controls

Once the machine is ready, you will see new buttons appear above every code box. Here is what they do:

* **▶ Run:** Click this to execute the code in that specific box. You will see the graph or answer appear immediately below it.
* **⟳ Restart:** This wipes the computer's memory clean. Use this if the code gets stuck or if you want to start over.
* **⏩ Restart & Run All:** This runs the entire experiment from the very first step to the last step automatically.

## 🧪 Experiment Fearlessly!

**You cannot break this book.**

We encourage you to click inside the code boxes and change the numbers.
* *What happens if you change the angle from 45° to 90°?*
* *What happens if you change the color from 'red' to 'blue'?*

Go ahead and try it! If you make a mistake or get an error, simply refresh the page or click **Restart**, and everything will return to the original settings.

**Select your Class from the sidebar to begin your experiments.**
