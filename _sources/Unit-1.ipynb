    "A **code editor** is like a simple, blank piece of parchment (`patra`) and a pen (`lekhani`). It's a clean place where you write your code, but that's often all it does. Common examples are **Notepad** (on Windows) or **Sublime Text**.\n",

    "* **A Guide (`shabdakosh`):** A helper who suggests the right words as you type (auto-completion).\n",
    "* **A Corrector (`vyakaran`):** A helper who puts a red line under any spelling or grammar mistakes in your code, helping you fix them (debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular IDEs, especially for Python, include **PyCharm Community**, the beginner-friendly **Thonny**, or the very powerful **Visual Studio Community**.\n",
